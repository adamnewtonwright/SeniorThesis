\begin{itemize}
  \item Frequency double the Duetto
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Hopefully our current crystal works; I will need to learn more about this crystal and see how I can get it to work (look into intensity/power needed, tolerance,temperature).
	  \item Make sure I can control the temperature of the crystal, and characterize the crystal (ideal temperature, efficiency, etc.).
	  \item If it turns that our current crystal does not work, I need to order a new one (which will probably take about a month).
	\end{itemize}
  \item If I somehow have time to spare, look into and start designing the dye laser cavity
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Find small enough dye cell that will handle pressure
	  \item Sketch out rough layout of configuration
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
