\@doendnote{endnote1}{The idea of magnetic resonant pulsing is analogous to pushing a child on a swing. If you apply a constant force the whole time, your child will not establish a nice oscillation. However, if you give a good push at one point each oscillation, your kid will soon be swinging quite high on the swing set.}
