\begin{acknowledgments}
I would like to acknowledge and thank the following people and organizations for the help and support they have given me and this project:

\begin{description}
   \item Dr. Michaela Kleinert, for her support as an academic and laboratory advisor. She is an amazing professor and mentor with an extraordinary ability to teach, mentor, and advise. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work and learn under her.
   \item Dr. Jed Rembold, for his help with Vim, LaTex, and Python. He has given me a passion for most things computing, and has inspired many projects and helped me when those projects became riddled with bugs. 
   \item Luke Galbraith Russell, for his friendship. He has helped me stay passionate about physics, encouraged me when I was stressed out, spent long nights doing homework with me, and went to the gym with me the next morning at 6 am. 
   \item All of my lab partners, everyone in the Kleinert Lab, and the Physics cohort. You all are so awesome, helpful, and encouraging!
   \item The Physics Department professors: Dr. Daniel Borrero, Dr. Rick Watkins, Dr. David Altman, and Dr. Roberta Bigelow. You all are incredible wizards and have taught me everything I know.
   \item The National Science Foundation, for their financial support.
   \item Dr. Scott Bergeson from Brigham Young University, for his collaboration and support.
